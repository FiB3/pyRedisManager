# pyWebRedis
REDIS web manager written in async python (asyncio, aiohttp, aioredis).

This is currently Work in Progress.

Project scope:

- manage your REDIS via a web UI - first version will offer a web CLI, later versions may offer more extensive options,
- use it locally or in cloud,
- authentication,
- easy way to set your instance.

## How to use:

This project is done, so it is easy to run.
For running locally do:

1. Setup REDIS.
2. Install requirements (via `pip`). I recommend to use virtualenv.
3. Run server via `server.py` at project's folder.

Description of setting the project (or running it elsewhere) will come soon.
